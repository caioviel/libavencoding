-------------------- Library AVEncoding --------------------

The library avencoding can realize audio/video transcoding and streaming in the must used formats.
It's developed for Linux, but can be compiled to other plataforms because it use cmake for generate compiling scripts.

Some features present are:

-> Easy file transcoding API;
-> RTP and UDP streming;
-> Capture audio e video from devices such as X11, alsa e video4linux; e
-> Take snapshots and generate image files from devices or files.

-------------------- Dependencies --------------------

The libavencoding has the following dependencies:

-> cmake (sudo apt-get install cmake)
-> libx11-dev (sudo apt-get install libx11-dev)
-> libcpputil (https://github.com/lince/libcpputil)
-> libffmpgeg-c (https://github.com/lince/libffmpeg-c)

-------------------- Installing --------------------

The steps to compile and install the libavencoding are the following:

$ git clone git://github.com/lince/libavencoding.git libavencoding
$ cd libavencoding
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

Optionaly, you also can generate the documentation of the library, in the root directory:

$ dogygen

-------------------- Using --------------------

To use the library you must include the header files of the desired class and link the library with a -lavencoding.

For utilization samples, see the test files on directory test. For API documentation, see the directory doc.

-------------------- Directories Structure --------------------

The root director libavencoding contains four directories and, due to installing process, two more can be generated.
The directories and their descriptions are the following:

-> include: It's here that the c++ headers file are.
-> src: It's here that the c++ source files of the library are.
-> bindings: It's here that the code for bindings with other language is. Actually there is only code for java.
-> test: It's here that several programs designed to test our library are. You can use it as samples code.
-> build: This directory is used durring the compilation process. You can delete it if you want.
-> doc: It's that the doxygen puts the generated documentation files.
